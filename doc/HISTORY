Prehistory
----------

June 2016
:   Discussions on SAGenealogie.com on the need to update GEN2SA, 
    a program written in Clipper for MSDOS that is avaiable gratis but
    only as a binary and requires DOS emulation software to run on modern 
    systems.

July to December 2016
:   Various false starts in search of a language in which to write a new
    free _libre_ open-source program.

January 2017
:   LifeLines identified as a basis, despite itself being software from
    the 1990s that has hardly evolved since then, for the following
    reasons:
    1. Lossless importing of GEDCOM files
    2. Powerful scripting language for report generation
    3. Revitalized development team with source repository on
        [GitHub](https://github.com/MarcNo/lifelines)
    4. Linux-friendly (in Ubuntu, which is my system) but porting
        to Windows is not an unsurmountable obstacle

9 February 2017
:   GitHub repository created.

19 February 2017
:   `gedcom.lua` module seems to be working so far as it goes.
